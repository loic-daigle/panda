"""
PlatformIO pre-build script: make the arduino-esp32 core define _btLibraryInUse
in a BLE-controller-only build.

The core header cores/esp32/esp32-hal-bt-mem.h emits a constructor
(_setBtLibraryInUse) that references `_btLibraryInUse` whenever BLE hardware is
present, but the core only DEFINES that symbol (in esp32-hal-bt.c) when an IDF
host stack -- CONFIG_BLUEDROID_ENABLED or CONFIG_NIMBLE_ENABLED -- is enabled.

panda runs the ESP-IDF BLE *controller* only, with NimBLE-Arduino supplying
the host (both IDF host stacks are disabled in custom_sdkconfig to avoid duplicate
npl_freertos_* symbols). In that configuration the core never defines the symbol,
so NimBLE's constructor link-fails with "undefined reference to `_btLibraryInUse'"
-- and it fails in links that application source cannot reach (the final firmware
link and the arduino-lib-builder core-rebuild's dummy firmware). src/BtLibraryInUseShim.cpp
covers the former; this script covers the latter.

Fix: turn the header's `extern bool _btLibraryInUse;` DECLARATION into a weak
DEFINITION. Every translation unit that includes the header (NimBLE) then provides
the symbol itself; the linker merges the duplicate weak defs, and the core's own
strong definition still wins whenever a host stack is actually enabled. It must
live in the header, not our src, because only the header is seen by NimBLE's TU in
every link.

Idempotent text edit. Patching bumps the header mtime, so NimBLE recompiles
against it on the next build.
